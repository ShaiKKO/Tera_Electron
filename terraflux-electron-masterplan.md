## SESSION START PROCEDURE

1. Re-read this master plan
2. Identify current phase and task
3. Review the specific tasks for the current focus area
4. Check which files are allowed to be modified
5. Continue development strictly within these boundaries

This master plan will be used as our guide to maintain development focus and prevent the creation of dependencies on unimplemented systems. By following this strict linear progression, we ensure testability and prevent rework.
