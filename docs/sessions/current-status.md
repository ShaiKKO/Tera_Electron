# TerraFlux Development Status

**Date:** May 17, 2025
**Current Phase:** 4 - World Generation System
**Current Task:** World Map Structure Implementation
**Next Milestone:** CP4.1 - Verify world map structure correctly stores and retrieves tiles

## Recent Accomplishments

### Phase 3: Rendering System (COMPLETED)
- ✅ **PixiJS Integration (CP 3.1)**: Successfully integrated PixiJS renderer with proper configuration, layer management, and texture handling
- ✅ **Camera System (CP 3.2)**: Implemented RimWorld-style camera controls with intuitive navigation, momentum-based movement, and advanced features
- ✅ **Tile Rendering System (CP 3.3)**: Created hex tile rendering with proper positioning, biome variations, and overlay system
- ✅ **Entity Rendering System (CP 3.4)**: Implemented animation and visual effects system with comprehensive test environment

### Development Plan Updates
- **Updated Master Plan**: Revised development plan to incorporate SpacetimeDB integration
- **Created SpacetimeDB Documentation**: Developed comprehensive documentation covering:
  - Integration architecture and approach
  - Dual-mode operation (offline and online)
  - Schema design for game entities
  - Multiplayer feature specifications
  - Setup and configuration guide

## Current Focus

Beginning Phase 4 (World Generation System) with the following tasks:

1. Implement `WorldMap` class with hex tile storage
2. Create `HexTile` class with properties and serialization
3. Develop biome type enumeration and properties
4. Implement resource storage system for tiles
5. Create feature placement system for special world elements

## Next Steps

1. Create the basic structure for the `WorldMap` class
2. Integrate with existing hex grid coordinate system
3. Develop serialization/deserialization for world maps
4. Implement tile property management
5. Create test harness for world generation verification

## SpacetimeDB Integration Plan

We've planned a new Phase 4.5 focused on SpacetimeDB integration to be tackled after completing the World Generation System:

1. **Setup and Configuration**:
   - Install dependencies and set up development environment
   - Configure local SpacetimeDB instance for testing

2. **Schema Design**:
   - Define initial schema for world data structures
   - Create comprehensive entity representations
   - Develop versioning strategy for schema evolution

3. **Abstraction Layer**:
   - Create adapter between existing data models and SpacetimeDB
   - Implement dual-mode architecture (offline/online)
   - Develop synchronization utilities

4. **Testing Infrastructure**:
   - Create test framework for SpacetimeDB operations
   - Implement verification tools for data integrity
   - Develop simulation capabilities for network conditions

## Technical Notes

- The animation and effects systems are fully implemented and tested
- Performance benchmarks meet or exceed targets on reference hardware
- Current implementation uses placeholder graphics that will be replaced with proper art assets
- The world generation system will build upon existing coordinate and rendering systems
- The SpacetimeDB integration will replace the original Socket.IO/MongoDB approach for multiplayer

## Open Issues

- None at this time
