# Current Development Status

**Date**: May 16, 2025  
**Current Phase**: Phase 3 - Rendering System  
**Current Task**: Tile Rendering System Implementation  
**Next Milestone**: CP3.3 - Verify tiles render correctly with proper overlays  

## Overall Progress Summary

Development is progressing according to schedule with Phase 3 (Rendering System) now approximately 70% complete. The first two major components of Phase 3 have been successfully implemented:

1. ✅ PixiJS Integration (CP3.1)
2. ✅ Camera System (CP3.2)

We're now working on the Tile Rendering System (CP3.3) and have completed the detailed implementation strategy document that will guide our development process. This document defines the visual aesthetics, shader implementations, system architecture, and optimization strategies for the tile rendering system.

## Recent Accomplishments

### Camera System (CP3.2) - COMPLETED
The Camera System implementation has been successfully completed with all requirements met:

- ✅ Implemented RimWorld-style camera controls with intuitive navigation
- ✅ Added zoom functionality with proper bounds and smooth behavior
- ✅ Created panning with momentum and boundary enforcement
- ✅ Implemented camera focus capabilities and entity following
- ✅ Added camera shake and animation effects with configurable parameters
- ✅ Ensured browser compatibility with passive event listeners and alternative input methods
- ✅ Enhanced user experience with double-click centering and Alt+Left click alternative for camera panning

All identified issues have been addressed:
- Mouse wheel zoom now uses passive event listeners to prevent errors
- Alternative camera panning option (Alt+Left click) added for users without middle mouse buttons
- Double-click to center feature implemented for quick navigation
- Input event processing enhanced to prevent focus issues during drag operations

### Tile Rendering System (CP3.3) - IN PROGRESS
We've made progress on the Tile Rendering System with several key accomplishments:

- ✅ Created comprehensive implementation strategy document (`docs/decisions/tile-rendering-system.md`)
- ✅ Defined the "Crystalline Conquest" visual aesthetic with detailed shader requirements
- ✅ Designed complete component architecture for tile rendering
- ✅ Developed detailed shader implementations for core visual effects
- ✅ Planned performance optimization strategies for handling large tile maps
- ✅ Created phased implementation approach with clear milestones

## Next Steps

### Immediate Focus: Tile Rendering System Implementation (CP3.3)
According to our implementation strategy document, we will now begin the actual coding work on the Tile Rendering System with the following tasks:

1. Phase 1: Core Hex Tile Implementation
   - Create base `HexTile` class extending PIXI.Container with proper positioning
   - Implement `HexTileFactory` for generating different tile types
   - Develop `TileRenderSystem` with ECS integration
   - Build test harness for visual verification

2. Phase 2: Biome Variation and Visual Enhancement
   - Implement biome-specific visual characteristics
   - Create transition rendering between different biomes
   - Add shader-based visual enhancements for the crystalline aesthetic

3. Phase 3: Selection and Interaction System
   - Implement selection overlay system with highlighting
   - Add user interaction handlers
   - Connect to input system for seamless interaction

4. Phase 4: Fog of War and Exploration
   - Create fog of war visibility system with three states
   - Optimize visibility calculations
   - Implement exploration tracking visualization

### Required Implementations
- Hex tile sprite generation and positioning using the coordinate system established in Phase 2
- Biome-specific visual variations with proper blending at borders
- Selection overlay system with highlighting and interaction feedback
- Fog of war system that integrates with the exploration mechanics planned for Phase 4

## Resource Requirements

For the Tile Rendering System, we'll need to create:
- Hex tile sprite templates for different biome types
- Transition sprites for blending between different biomes
- Selection and highlight overlay graphics
- Fog of war shader or masking system
- Custom shaders for the "Crystalline Conquest" aesthetic

## Work Environment

All necessary tools and frameworks have been successfully configured and tested:
- PixiJS is properly integrated and performing well
- Camera system provides smooth navigation and interaction
- Webpack build system is configured correctly for rendering components
- Test harnesses exist for visual verification of rendering systems

## Risk Assessment

The integration of the tile rendering system with the existing coordinate system may present some challenges, particularly around:
- Proper positioning and alignment of hexagonal tiles
- Performance considerations for large tile maps
- Visual quality at tile boundaries
- Shader complexity and performance on various hardware

These risks will be actively monitored and mitigated through the development process.

## Current Test Status

All checkpoints up to CP3.2 have been validated and passed. Test harnesses are in place for:
- Camera system interaction and performance
- Coordinate system verification
- PixiJS rendering performance

## Next Development Session

The next development session will focus on implementing Phase 1 of our strategy:
1. Creating the base `HexTile` class with proper positioning
2. Implementing the `HexTileFactory` for generating different tile types
3. Developing the core `TileRenderSystem` with ECS integration
4. Building a test harness for visual verification
