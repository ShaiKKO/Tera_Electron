# Checkpoint: SpacetimeDB Integration Decision

**Date:** May 17, 2025
**Status:** Approved
**Phase:** 4 - World Generation System (Pre-implementation)
**Decision Maker:** Project Lead
**Implementation Timeline:** Phase 4.5 (After World Generation System completion)

## Summary

The TerraFlux development team has decided to replace the originally planned Socket.IO/Express + MongoDB approach for multiplayer with SpacetimeDB. This document summarizes the decision rationale, implementation plan, and expected benefits.

## Problem Statement

The original multiplayer architecture for TerraFlux had several challenges:

1. **Complexity**: Managing real-time synchronization with Socket.IO required custom implementation of conflict resolution
2. **Scalability**: MongoDB-based persistence model would require additional caching layers for performance
3. **Latency**: Traditional client-server architecture would introduce perceptible lag in game interactions
4. **Maintenance**: Separate management of different technology stacks for networking and persistence

## Decision

Adopt SpacetimeDB as a unified solution for both real-time multiplayer synchronization and persistence, replacing both Socket.IO/Express and MongoDB in the technology stack.

## Benefits

1. **Built-in Conflict Resolution**: SpacetimeDB's architecture inherently handles conflicts in multiplayer scenarios
2. **Developer Productivity**: Unified tools and SDKs simplify development experience
3. **Performance**: Optimized specifically for game state synchronization
4. **Offline-First Support**: Better alignment with TerraFlux's design philosophy of seamless offline/online transitions
5. **Scalability**: Purpose-built for multiplayer game scenarios with similar requirements to TerraFlux

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Design & Documentation (COMPLETED)
- ✅ Research SpacetimeDB capabilities and limitations
- ✅ Document multiplayer architecture using SpacetimeDB
- ✅ Create schema designs for game entities
- ✅ Update technical documentation to reflect the new approach

### Phase 2: Core Integration (Phase 4.5 - After World Generation)
- Create SpacetimeDB client integration
- Develop dual-mode storage provider system
- Implement schema definitions
- Create entity adapters between game models and SpacetimeDB

### Phase 3: Feature Implementation
- Implement shared world exploration
- Develop real-time player interaction
- Create colony visiting functionality
- Implement expedition party system
- Develop convergence events

### Phase 4: Testing & Optimization
- Performance testing under various network conditions
- Scale testing with multiple simultaneous players
- Edge case validation for sync
- Security review

## Technical Specifications

* **Client Integration**: TypeScript SDK with abstraction layer
* **Schema Design**: Atomically consistent schema for game entities
* **Storage Pattern**: Dual-mode storage with local-first capability
* **Network Usage**: Optimized delta compression
* **Synchronization**: Automatic with manual override capabilities
* **Security**: Role-based access with fine-grained permissions

## Risk Assessment

1. **Technology Maturity**: SpacetimeDB is relatively newer than Socket.IO/MongoDB
   * Mitigation: Thorough testing and fallback options where needed

2. **Learning Curve**: Team needs to learn SpacetimeDB specifics
   * Mitigation: Documentation and structured knowledge transfer

3. **Migration**: Future migrations may be required
   * Mitigation: Design with versioning in schema from day one

## Conclusion

The migration to SpacetimeDB represents a strategic decision to simplify our architecture while improving core multiplayer capabilities. The integration will enable more robust and performant multiplayer features with less custom code. This checkpoint marks the completion of the planning phase for SpacetimeDB integration, with implementation scheduled for Phase 4.5 of development.
