# SpacetimeDB Integration Decision

## Context

TerraFlux requires a robust multiplayer foundation that can handle real-time synchronized state across clients, support complex data relationships, and provide reliable persistence. We considered several approaches:

1. Custom Socket.IO server with MongoDB (original plan)
2. Firebase Realtime Database
3. SpacetimeDB
4. Custom WebSocket server with PostgreSQL

## Decision

We have decided to use SpacetimeDB as the foundation for TerraFlux's multiplayer features, replacing the previously planned Socket.IO + MongoDB approach.

## Rationale

SpacetimeDB provides several advantages that align with our needs:

1. **Built-in conflict resolution** - Handles simultaneous updates gracefully, which is critical for a multiplayer game with real-time state changes
2. **Relational data model** - Better fits our complex entity relationships between worlds, tiles, colonies, colonists, and resources
3. **Real-time synchronization** - Native support for the live updates required for multiplayer interactions
4. **Strong consistency guarantees** - Important for game state integrity, especially during critical operations
5. **Reduced server-side code** - SpacetimeDB handles much of the functionality we'd otherwise need to implement manually
6. **SQL query capabilities** - Allows for complex data operations and efficient querying
7. **Integration with our existing TypeScript/JavaScript stack** - Minimizes the learning curve and adaptation required
8. **Performance optimization** - Designed for efficient state synchronization with minimal network bandwidth usage

## Implementation Strategy

Our implementation will follow a phased approach:

1. **Phase 4.5: Foundation**
   - Set up SpacetimeDB integration
   - Create schema for world data
   - Implement dual-mode architecture
   - Develop migration utilities

2. **Throughout Phases 5-7**
   - Design new systems with SpacetimeDB in mind
   - Gradually extend schema as new systems are added
   - Add dual-mode support for each new feature
   - Test both modes during development

3. **Phase 8: Full Multiplayer**
   - Complete multiplayer-specific features
   - Finalize conflict resolution strategies
   - Implement specialized interaction features
   - Deploy production SpacetimeDB instances

## Technical Approach

We will:
1. Create an abstraction layer so game systems don't directly depend on SpacetimeDB
2. Use feature flags to enable/disable SpacetimeDB integration
3. Maintain full offline functionality even with online capabilities
4. Design schemas carefully to optimize for our specific access patterns
5. Implement comprehensive testing for both modes
6. Create client-side prediction for responsive gameplay

## Risks and Mitigations

1. **Data volume and performance concerns**
   - *Risk*: World data could be quite large, potentially causing sync performance issues
   - *Mitigation*: Implement partial synchronization for large worlds, synchronize only active regions, and use delta updates

2. **Learning curve**
   - *Risk*: Team may take time to adapt to SpacetimeDB patterns
   - *Mitigation*: Schedule time for team training, create comprehensive example implementations, and develop internal documentation

3. **Schema evolution**
   - *Risk*: As the game evolves, schema changes could be difficult to manage
   - *Mitigation*: Design robust migration utilities and versioning system to handle schema changes

4. **Offline play requirements**
   - *Risk*: Players expect full functionality even offline
   - *Mitigation*: Ensure local storage fallback works seamlessly, with transparent synchronization when reconnecting

5. **Deployment complexity**
   - *Risk*: Production deployment may be more complex than expected
   - *Mitigation*: Create comprehensive deployment automation and monitoring

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Custom Socket.IO + MongoDB (Original Plan)
While this approach would have worked, it would require us to implement many features that SpacetimeDB provides out of the box, including:
- Real-time updates distribution system
- Conflict resolution mechanisms
- Data synchronization protocols
- Storage layer optimized for gaming data

### 2. Firebase Realtime Database
Firebase would offer easy setup and good real-time capabilities, but:
- Less suitable for relational data (our game is heavily relational)
- More limited query capabilities compared to SpacetimeDB's SQL
- Higher cost at scale
- Less control over data structure and optimization

### 3. Custom WebSocket + PostgreSQL
This would provide strong relational capabilities, but:
- Significantly more server-side code to maintain
- More complex deployment and scaling
- Would require building real-time synchronization from scratch
- Higher development and maintenance burden

## Conclusion

After careful consideration of all options, SpacetimeDB presents the best combination of features, performance, and development efficiency for TerraFlux's multiplayer needs. The decision to integrate SpacetimeDB early (in Phase 4.5) rather than waiting until the multiplayer phase provides several benefits:

1. Building systems with SpacetimeDB in mind from the beginning will reduce refactoring later
2. We can incrementally develop and test multiplayer capabilities as we build other game systems
3. The dual-mode architecture will ensure both offline and online play work seamlessly
4. We can leverage SpacetimeDB's capabilities for game state management even in single-player mode

This approach aligns with our goal of creating a robust, scalable game that offers both excellent single-player and multiplayer experiences.
