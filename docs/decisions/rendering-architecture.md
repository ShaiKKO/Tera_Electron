# Rendering Architecture Design Decisions

This document records key architectural decisions made for the TerraFlux rendering system, including the context, alternatives considered, and rationale.

## Decision Record Format

Each decision is documented with the following structure:

- **Decision**: What was decided
- **Date**: When the decision was made
- **Context**: The situation that required a decision
- **Alternatives Considered**: Other options that were evaluated
- **Decision Rationale**: Why this approach was chosen
- **Consequences**: The resulting effects, both positive and negative
- **Status**: Current status of the decision (active, superseded, etc.)

## Decision: Use PixiJS as the rendering engine

- **Date**: Initial project setup
- **Context**: 
  - Need for a performant 2D rendering engine with WebGL support
  - Animation and sprite handling requirements
  - Cross-platform compatibility
  
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  - Three.js: More focused on 3D, would require more custom work for 2D
  - Custom WebGL: Too time-consuming to develop and optimize
  - HTML5 Canvas API: Lacks hardware acceleration and performance optimizations
  - Phaser: More game-oriented than needed, less flexibility for custom systems
  
- **Decision Rationale**:
  - PixiJS offers excellent 2D WebGL performance
  - Built-in sprite batching reduces draw calls
  - Well-documented API and active community
  - Flexible enough to integrate with our ECS architecture
  - Good support for texture atlases and asset management
  
- **Consequences**:
  - Positive: Simplified rendering code, better performance
  - Negative: Adds ~1MB to bundle size
  - Mitigation: Asset streaming and code splitting to manage initial load
  
- **Status**: Active

## Decision: Layer-based rendering architecture

- **Date**: Phase 3 implementation
- **Context**: 
  - Need to organize rendering order for different game elements
  - Support for effects that apply to entire layers
  - Requirements for batching similar elements together
  
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  - Depth-based sorting only: Simple but less structured
  - Scene graph hierarchy: More complex than needed
  - Single container with manual ordering: Would become difficult to maintain
  
- **Decision Rationale**:
  - Layers provide logical organization of visual elements
  - Easier to manage draw order and batching
  - Supports applying effects to groups of elements
  - Aligns well with game design (terrain layer, entity layer, UI layer, etc.)
  
- **Consequences**:
  - Positive: Cleaner code organization, better performance control
  - Positive: More intuitive for developers to work with
  - Negative: Slightly more complex than a flat structure
  - Mitigation: Clear documentation and abstraction
  
- **Status**: Active

## Decision: Component-based rendering with Renderable

- **Date**: Phase 3 implementation
- **Context**: 
  - Need to connect ECS architecture to the rendering system
  - Entities require visual representation
  - Properties like position and rotation need to affect visuals
  
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  - Separate renderer that queries entity data: More decoupled but less efficient
  - Direct integration of PixiJS objects into entities: Less separation of concerns
  - Observer pattern for entity changes: More complex event handling
  
- **Decision Rationale**:
  - Renderable component provides clean interface between entities and visuals
  - Maintains separation between game logic and rendering
  - Allows for flexible visual representations
  - Supports specialized rendering features like effects
  
- **Consequences**:
  - Positive: Clear separation of concerns
  - Positive: Easy to add/remove visual representation of entities
  - Negative: Some coupling between ECS and rendering system concepts
  - Mitigation: Clear interfaces and abstraction
  
- **Status**: Active

## Decision: Deferred texture loading

- **Date**: Phase 3 planning
- **Context**: 
  - Game may have many textures but not all needed immediately
  - Memory constraints, especially on lower-end devices
  - Initial load time concerns
  
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  - Eager loading of all textures: Simple but inefficient
  - Manual texture management: Error-prone and developer burden
  - Texture streaming with visible quality reduction: Poor user experience
  
- **Decision Rationale**:
  - Deferred loading improves initial startup time
  - Reduces memory usage by only keeping necessary textures loaded
  - TextureManager can intelligently handle caching and preloading
  
- **Consequences**:
  - Positive: Better memory usage and load times
  - Negative: Potential for missing textures if not properly preloaded
  - Mitigation: Automatic preloading of likely-needed assets
  
- **Status**: Planned

## Decision: Special effects implementation via fragment shaders

- **Date**: Phase 3 planning
- **Context**: 
  - Need for visual effects like crystalline and energy glow
  - Performance concerns for effects on many entities
  - Desire for high visual quality
  
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  - Sprite-based effects: Less performance impact but lower quality
  - Post-processing on entire scene: Less targeted
  - Pre-rendered effect textures: Less dynamic
  
- **Decision Rationale**:
  - GPU-based effects through WebGL shaders provide best performance
  - Allows for dynamic, parameterized effects
  - Can be applied selectively to specific entities
  
- **Consequences**:
  - Positive: High-quality effects with good performance
  - Negative: More complex implementation
  - Negative: Requires shader programming expertise
  - Mitigation: Create reusable shader library with simple parameter interface
  
- **Status**: Planned
